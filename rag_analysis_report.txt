5. KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

✓ RAG helps in 28.0% of cases, improving accuracy significantly
✗ RAG hurts in 11.0% of cases, reducing accuracy

Average retrieval score when RAG helps: 3.416
Average retrieval score when RAG hurts: 2.981

Recommendations:
  1. RAG shows strong benefits overall - continue using it
  2. Cases where RAG hurts often have lower retrieval confidence
  3. Smart Hybrid strategy successfully reduces harm cases
  4. Consider raising confidence threshold to filter more aggressively
  5. Certain question types benefit more - focus on those
